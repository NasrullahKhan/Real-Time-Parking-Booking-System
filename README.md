The proposed project is a smart real-time parking booking system that provides customers an easy way of reserving a parking space online. It overcomes the problem of finding a parking space in commercial areas that unnecessary consumes time. Hence this project offers a web or mobile based reservation system where users can view various parking areas and select the space to view whether space is available or not. If the booking space is available then he can book it for specific time slot. The booked space will be marked yellow and will not be available for anyone else for the specified time. This system provides an additional feature of cancelling the bookings. User can cancel their books space anytime. After making booking users are notified about the booking via email along with unique parking number. 
Modules:
•	Admin Login: The system is under supervision of admin who manages the bookings made. 
•	User login/registration: Users have to first register themselves to login into the system. 
•	Three Parking areas: The system will provide users with three parking areas of different locations.
•	Parking availability check: User can click on spaces to view the availability. If the space is already booked it will be marked yellow and the available ones will be seen in normal color.
•	Parking booking online for date and time: Users can book parking space for their required date and time.
•	Parking cancellation: User may even cancel their bookings by login into the system anytime.
